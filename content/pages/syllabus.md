Quantum Field Theory II (8.324)

Manohar, A., and M. Wise. _Heavy Quark Physics._ Cambridge, UK; New York City, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2000. ISBN: 9780521642415 (hb).

For other references, see the {{% resource_link 28cbfc1a-b891-8322-e854-3015bdb5a200 "readings" %}} sections.

Assignments
-----------

For the homework you will have a choice. You will be graded on 5 problem sets which may be chosen out of the 8-9 sets that will be handed out. This gives you an opportunity to do a good job on the subjects of most interest to you. I encourage you to look at all the problem sets. If you turn in a partial problem set it will also count partially towards the 5. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class. The writeup should be your own work.

Exams
-----

There are no exams.

Project
-------

Each student must explore an effective field theory subject and give a short presentation to the rest of the class.
