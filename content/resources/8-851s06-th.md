  caption: For most of your career you have been learning about more and more general
    theories. In this class we will do the opposite. We will learn how to devise specific
    "effective" theories which allow us to make more and more precise predictions,
    but still capture physics at different length scales. (Figure by Prof. Iain Stewart.)
